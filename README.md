# 🩺 **Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Image Classification**

This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify **lung** and **colon cancer tissues** from **histopathological images**. The dataset consists of 25,000 images across **5 categories**. The goal is to build a model capable of classifying cancerous tissues (Lung and Colon Adenocarcinoma, Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma) from normal tissues.
