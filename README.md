# 🩺 **Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Image Classification**

This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify **lung** and **colon cancer tissues** from **histopathological images**. The dataset consists of 25,000 images across **5 categories**. The goal is to build a model capable of classifying cancerous tissues (Lung and Colon Adenocarcinoma, Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma) from normal tissues.

## 📂 **Dataset Overview**

The dataset contains histopathological images from **Lung** and **Colon** cancer tissues. It has **5 categories**:

- **Colon Tissue**:
  - `colon_aca`: Colon Adenocarcinoma
  - `colon_n`: Normal Colon Tissue
- **Lung Tissue**:
  - `lung_aca`: Lung Adenocarcinoma
  - `lung_n`: Normal Lung Tissue
  - `lung_scc`: Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma

You can download the dataset from Kaggle here: [Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images).

## 📜 **Model Development**

In this section, we describe the architecture of the deep learning model used for classification. The model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze the histopathological images.

### Steps:
1. Data preprocessing:
   - Resize images
   - Normalize pixel values
   - Data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip)

2. Model Architecture:
   - CNN layers with Batch Normalization
   - Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
   - Dense output layer with softmax activation function for multi-class classification

3. Compilation and Training:
   - Loss: `categorical_crossentropy`
   - Optimizer: `Adam`
   - Evaluation metric: `accuracy`

---

## 📊 **Results**

Once the model is trained, we evaluate its performance on a separate validation set. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are reported.

The final results are visualized using confusion matrices and performance plots.
